Milestone Project 1 : Movie Collection App

User Story:
    As a user I would like to be able to...
        1. Add new movies to my collection, so I can keep track of all my movies
        2. List all the movies in my collection, so I can see what I already have
        3. Find a movie by using the movie title, so I can locate a specific move when my collection grows
        
    I would also like this to be able to...(BONUS)
        1. Check to see which movies I have seen, so I can keep track of what movies I still have yet to watch
        2. Search for a movie using the directors or other attributes, so I can find my specific movie

    Implementation tasks
        - Decide where to store movies in code                              *in a csv file called movies.csv
        - Decide what data we want to store for each movie                  *title, directors, year, genre, etc
        - Show the user a menu and let them pick an option
        - Implement each requirement in turn, each as a separate function
        - Stop running the program when they type 'q' in the menu
